# Python_API-Challenge
Module 6 Challenge by William Fetter
Objectives: To answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
            In this assignment, we will create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Uinge the citipy Python   
            libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

Inputs: 
     - VacationPy.ipynb for background data
     - WeatherPy.ipynb for background data
     
Outputs:
  **  Part 1**
    - Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
    - Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
  **  Part 2**
    - Use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ Python skills to create map visualizations.
    
Resources:
Class information and videos - for basics of coding and building foundation
Stack overflow - for trouble shooting, and researching best code practices
